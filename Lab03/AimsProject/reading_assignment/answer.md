**Question 1 (Section 6): If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?**
* No, Java doesn't. Because only one arg accept in a case. If you use create some constructors same case with different args, JVM won't know whether arg is title or category.
